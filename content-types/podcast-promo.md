# Content Type: Podcast Promo Post

## Overview

- **Command flag:** `--podcast-promo` (or selected during Step 4)
- **One-line description:** A scroll-stopping promo post for a new podcast episode that delivers standalone value, published on X and LinkedIn
- **Typical length:** 200-400 words (X version); 250-450 words (LinkedIn version)
- **Platform:** X and LinkedIn (dual format — draft both versions)

## Pipeline

**Pipeline:** custom

This content type does NOT use the standard Steps 1-6. Instead:

1. **P1: Episode intake** — Read the episode transcript. Identify the guest, their credibility, and the 3-5 most compelling tactical moments (specific systems, frameworks, workflows, stats, tools, or contrarian insights).
2. **P2: Hook mining** — From those moments, draft 3 candidate hooks using the formulas below. Pick the strongest.
3. **P3: Tactic extraction** — Distill the guest's core system or argument into a concrete, step-by-step breakdown (3-6 steps) or numbered insight list. This is the meat of the post. A reader should walk away with tangible value even if they never watch the episode.
4. **P4: Draft** — Write the X version first (tighter constraints), then adapt for LinkedIn.
5. **P5: Review** — Self-check against the format spec below. Verify it passes the "scroll-stop test," the "standalone value test" (would someone learn something real just from reading this?), and the "but I still want to watch" test (does the post create desire to see it in action?).

## Format Specification

### Structure (X version)

The post follows a **Hook → Bridge → System/Tactics → Insight → CTA** structure:

1. **Hook (1-3 sentences)** — A provocative stat, contrarian take, or outcome-first tease pulled directly from the episode. This must work as a standalone screenshot. It should create tension, curiosity, or disbelief.
2. **Bridge (1-2 sentences)** — Introduce the guest with @mention and their credibility marker. Connect them to the hook. Establish why this person's system is worth paying attention to.
3. **System/Tactics (numbered list, 3-6 items)** — The core of the post. Break down the guest's actual system, workflow, or argument in specific, tactical detail. Use real tool names, real numbers, real frameworks. Each step should be concrete enough that someone could start acting on it. Use numbered fragments in casual voice (1) 2) 3) etc.).
4. **Killer quote or insight (1-2 sentences)** — The guest's single best line or the insight that reframes how the reader thinks about the topic.
5. **CTA** — Can be as simple as "full episode: [link]" or a direct pointer to the video. Do NOT use "check it out" or "don't miss this." The post's value should make the CTA obvious.

### Structure (LinkedIn version)

Same Hook → Bridge → System/Tactics → Insight → CTA structure, but:

- **Bold step headers** for each tactic (e.g., "**Step 1: Mine your ICP's language.**") for scannability
- More complete sentences within each step
- Slightly expanded explanations (1-2 sentences per step vs. fragments)
- Can include a closing insight paragraph that frames the bigger takeaway
- End with a clear CTA or engagement hook

### Hook Formulas (draft 3 options, pick the strongest)

1. **The Outcome-First Tease:** Lead with the guest's most impressive result, then promise the how.
   - e.g., "@DBredvick compressed @vercel's sales team from 20 people to 2."
2. **The Contrarian Opener:** Start with a belief you held, then introduce the guest who changed your mind.
   - e.g., "I thought AEO was a hunk of bullsh*t. And then i spoke to @kippbodnar..."
3. **The Stat Bomb:** Lead with a surprising number that demands explanation.
   - e.g., "McKinsey surveyed 2,000 companies in 2025. 51% said AI backfired on them."
4. **The Credibility + Skepticism:** Open with what the guest claimed and the doubt it generated, then deliver the proof.
   - e.g., "[Guest] claimed [bold claim]. people called him a fraud. so i got him on the show to prove it live."

**Always draft 3 hook options in the working file before picking one.** Label them Option A, B, C with which formula each uses. Pick the one that would make you stop scrolling. Include all 3 in the draft so you can revisit if the first choice doesn't land during revision.

### Voice & Tone Adaptation

**X version:** Full casual voice. Lowercase fine. Fragments fine. Strategic profanity fine. Write like you're telling a friend about a conversation that blew your mind — but you're also giving them the actual playbook.

**LinkedIn version:** Professional-casual. Complete sentences more often. Still conversational, not corporate. Bold headers for each step. Can include bold text for key stats or takeaways.

### Length & Constraints

**X version:**
- Single post (not a thread), but use long-form X post format
- 200-400 words typical (needs room for tactical substance)
- Must include guest @mention
- Attach episode link or video thumbnail

**LinkedIn version:**
- 250-450 words
- Must work above the fold (~210 characters for hook)
- Bold step headers are non-negotiable for scannability
- Include guest @mention or tag
- Attach episode link or video thumbnail

## Drafting Instructions

1. Read the episode transcript (or watch the episode)
2. Identify the guest's core system or argument — what is the thing they do or believe that is worth sharing?
3. Break that system into 3-6 concrete, tactical steps with specific tools, numbers, and frameworks
4. Identify the guest's single best quote or insight that reframes the topic
5. Write 3 hook options using the formulas above — pick the one that would make YOU stop scrolling
6. Write the X version first — numbered fragments, casual voice, real specifics
7. Adapt to LinkedIn — bold step headers, slightly expanded explanations, closing insight paragraph
8. **The standalone value test:** Cover the post and ask "did I learn something actionable?" If no, add more tactical detail.
9. **The "but I still want to watch" test:** The post gives you the system, but the episode gives you the live demo, the nuance, the Q&A. The post should make someone think "i get the framework, but i need to see this in action."

## Council Adaptations

Skip the full Writer's Council. Instead, run a lightweight check:

- **Shaan Puri check:** "Would I stop scrolling for this hook?" If no, rewrite the hook.
- **Greg Isenberg check:** "Can someone steal a tactic from this post and use it today?" If no, the tactics aren't specific enough.
- **Slop Detector check:** "Does this sound like a generic podcast promo?" If yes, you haven't extracted enough real substance from the episode.

## Revision Notes

- The hook gets them to read. The tactics get them to save/share. Both matter equally.
- Specificity > hype. Real tool names, real dollar amounts, real step counts. "Uses Perplexity to search Reddit for ICP pain points" beats "does deep customer research."
- The guest @mention is non-negotiable — it drives distribution via their network.
- Do NOT just tease the episode — deliver a mini-playbook. The video becomes "see this in action" rather than "learn what happened."
- The best podcast promo posts are ones people bookmark even if they never watch the episode.
- A great killer quote from the guest gives the post a memorable anchor. Find the one line that would make someone screenshot the post.
