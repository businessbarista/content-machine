### Core Style DNA
- **Conversational authenticity** - writes like talking to a smart friend
- **Contrarian confidence** - willing to take unpopular positions
- **Practical value orientation** - always ties back to actionable insights
- **Vulnerability balanced with authority** - admits not knowing while demonstrating expertise
- **Energy and enthusiasm** - genuine excitement comes through

### THE #1 RULE: Write Like You're Texting a Friend

**This is the most important stylistic directive.** Every post should read like a text conversation between friends—casual, direct, unpolished in the right ways.

**What this means:**
- Lowercase is fine, especially for emphasis ("i sold my company for millions and felt nothing")
- Sentence fragments are encouraged ("biggest purchase i made after? a mini bernedoodle")
- No corporate-speak, no polished prose, no "writing voice"
- Contractions always ("i'm" not "I am", "didn't" not "did not")
- Start sentences with "and", "but", "so", "like"
- Use verbal tics and natural speech patterns ("you know?", "honestly?", "like...")
- Punctuation is loose—periods for rhythm, not grammar

**The test:** Read it out loud. If it sounds like something you'd say to a friend over drinks, it's right. If it sounds like something you'd write in an email to your boss, rewrite it.

---

## Voice & Tone

### Primary Voice Characteristics

#### 1. Conversational Authenticity
Alex writes like he's texting a smart friend, not writing a corporate memo.

**Examples:**
- "No joke, I've completely shifted from powerpoint to Lovable for 100% of my slide decks."
- "whoever decided to make .heic the default image file on macs is a reallll asshole."
- "I'm floored that the vast minority of people I interview send thank you emails."
- "I will be Alex Honnold's agent pro-bono."
- "it sounds clichey af, but the speed & progress in ai truly is once in a lifetime."

#### 2. Controlled Profanity
Strategic use of mild profanity for emphasis and authenticity:
- "reallll asshole"
- "f*ck that"
- "clichey af"
- "What the f*ck is an AI agent?"
- "f*ck it"

**Pattern:** Profanity is used sparingly and always for emphasis, never gratuitously. Often asterisked for softening.

#### 3. Self-Deprecating Confidence
Admits limitations while maintaining authority:
- "I have never taken a coding class. I had never shipped a piece of software pre-AI."
- "I'm non-technical & I want to deeply understand AI"
- "HubSpot's CMO just told me my AEO playbook is trash. I really don't fully know what that means."

#### 4. Enthusiastic Conviction
Expresses genuine excitement without being performative:
- "I'm having the most fun i've ever had in my career right now."
- "the seismic shift happening before our eyes is truly once in a lifetime."
- "Creating Claude Code Community is one of the best decisions I've made professionally."

### Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Hot takes | Blunt, direct | "whoever decided to make .heic the default image file on macs is a reallll asshole." |
| Teaching | Generous, accessible | "Here are my biggest takeaways and questions from his 60-minute talk:" |
| Hiring posts | Transparent, honest | "For most of you, this will be a horrible job. - mind-numbing work - in-office (NYC) - bad pay" |
| Personal reflection | Vulnerable, genuine | "This isn't the type of post that will go viral. But it's more important than almost everything I'll say on here." |
| Business insights | Authoritative, experienced | "I'm 6 months into building McKinsey for AI. It's 100% bootstrapped, the fastest-growing business I've started" |

## Hook Formulas

### Top-Performing Hook Categories

#### 1. The Contrarian Declaration
Opens with a statement that challenges conventional wisdom.

**Formula:** [Contrarian statement]. [Brief context or expansion].

**Examples:**
- "GPT 5.1 is way bigger than people think imho."
- "whoever decided to make .heic the default image file on macs is a reallll asshole."
- "I used to think core values were total bullshit."
- "Hot take: one-shotting isn't a bad thing."

**Why it works:** Creates immediate tension and curiosity. Reader wants to know the reasoning.

#### 2. The Personal Revelation
Shares a personal behavior or discovery that implies broader insight.

**Formula:** [Personal action/discovery]. [Implication or result].

**Examples:**
- "No joke, I've completely shifted from powerpoint to Lovable for 100% of my slide decks."
- "I will be Alex Honnold's agent pro-bono."
- "I will be buying one f*ck ton of google stock."

**Why it works:** Personal stakes create credibility. Reader thinks "if he's doing it, maybe I should too."

#### 3. The Numbers Hook
Leads with a specific, impressive statistic.

**Formula:** [Impressive number] + [context that makes it meaningful].

**Examples:**
- "This guy has racked up 300M views exclusively with AI-only commercials."
- "I drove 5 million impressions this month."
- "A $9.3 billion company trained an AI agent on its best salesperson."
- "I have 282k followers and drove 5m impressions in Jan. My buddy has 6k and drove 4m impressions in Jan."

**Why it works:** Specific numbers create credibility and intrigue about the "how."

#### 4. The Provocative Question
Opens with a question that challenges the reader.

**Formula:** [Provocative question]? [Setup for the answer].

**Examples:**
- "WTF is an AI agent?"
- "What is the highest ROI AI use case you currently use?"
- "If you could have iMessage Wrapped, what stats, trends, or awards would you love to see?"

**Why it works:** Engages the reader's brain immediately; they start formulating their own answer.

#### 5. The Behind-the-Scenes Reveal
Offers insider access to a conversation or experience.

**Formula:** [Context of insider moment]. [The surprising insight].

**Examples:**
- "Pretty wild convo I just had with the Head of AI at a $50bn tech company."
- "Was just talking to the CEO of a $10m medical supplies business."
- "I was interviewing someone from a Big 4 consultancy today."
- "Spoke to a very senior exec today who said F100 companies have basically seen zero benefit from AI."

**Why it works:** Creates FOMO and positions Alex as an insider with access.

#### 6. The Outcome-First Tease
Leads with an impressive outcome, then promises the "how."

**Formula:** [Impressive outcome]. Here's how/Here's the [method]:

**Examples:**
- "This shower idea saved Vercel $2m."
- "@DBredvick compressed @vercel's sales team from 20 people to 2."
- "I use a killer tool to help me create 1,000+ posts per year, while being a full-time founder."
- "Claude Code built me an immersive software course in 5 minutes."

**Why it works:** Outcome creates desire; promise of "how" creates a reason to keep reading.

#### 7. The Community/Movement Hook
Invites people into something bigger than themselves.

**Formula:** [Announcement of community/movement]. [Value proposition].

**Examples:**
- "I want to start a community dedicated to Claude Code."
- "We officially launched a community dedicated to Claude Code!"
- "Creating Claude Code Community is one of the best decisions I've made professionally."

**Why it works:** Taps into belonging; people want to be part of something.

```
11 observations interviewing 500+ engineers the last 9 months:
1) The new H1B visa thing is a big bummer...
2) There are very few true...
```

**Pattern notes:**
- Numbers often in parentheses: "1)" not "1."
- Each item is a complete thought

**Best for:** Personal insights, lessons learned, business updates

**Format:**
```
[Setup: the situation]
[Conflict: the problem/challenge]
[Resolution: what happened/what I learned]

```

**Example:**
```
About 9 months ago, my cofounder and I sat in a NYC coworking space playing a game of "what ifs."
- What if we build McKinsey for AI?
- What if we pay engineers like salespeople?
- What if we scale like a top 0.1% Silicon Valley startup, but raise no money?
Wouldn't that be...
```

### Structure 3: The Contrarian Argument
**Best for:** Hot takes, industry commentary, thought leadership

**Format:**
```
[Contrarian claim]
[Acknowledgment of opposing view]
[Your reasoning]
[Evidence/examples]
```

**Example:**
```
GPT 5.1 is way bigger than people think imho.
No this wasn't a model shift like 3.0 to 3.5, but I'd argue we're at a level of intelligence now, where things like personality, adaptive thinking, and custom instructions will have a more profound impact on the average user than...
```

### Structure 4: The Show-Your-Work
**Best for:** Learning in public, educational content, reviews

**Format:**
```
[What I did/studied]

Here are my biggest takeaways and questions from his 60-minute talk:
1. A large language model is "just two files."...
```

**Best for:** Hiring, events, product launches, community building

**Format:**

**Format:**
```
[Observation of pattern]

The most AI-native ops ppl? Engineers.
Because the technology is outpacing the tooling, I'm seeing...
```

## Engagement Drivers

### What Makes Posts Go Viral

**Example:** "Pretty wild convo I just had with the Head of AI at a $50bn tech company."

#### 3. Contrarian + Confident
**Pattern:** State an unpopular opinion with conviction (no hedging).

**Example:** "I will be buying one f*ck ton of google stock. This is not investment advice."

#### 4. Generous Value Delivery
**Pattern:** Give away something actionable without gatekeeping.

**Example:** Sharing the full deep research prompt template.

#### 5. Vulnerability + Authority
**Pattern:** Admit a limitation while demonstrating expertise.

**Example:** "I'm non-technical but want to deeply understand AI. Here are my biggest takeaways..."

#### 6. Community Creation
**Pattern:** Invite people into something exclusive.

**Example:** Claude Code Community launch with "easter egg" application.

### Engagement Mechanics

**High bookmark posts (>100):** Always deliver tangible value (prompts, frameworks, lists)

**High reply posts:** Ask direct questions or state controversial opinions

**High retweet posts:** Contain quotable one-liners or relatable observations

- Use line breaks liberally

**Engagement Tactics:**

**#1: Hiring 100 People Post (7,708 engagements, 275k impressions)**
```
"I need to hire 100 people in the next 12 months. Tenex is a rocket ship. Unlike anything i've seen. Our biggest bottleneck is keeping up hiring with the tidal wave of demand we're seeing. Which takes me to the first role I need to fill: Director of People Ops..."

[Continues with detailed role descriptions for Director of People Ops, AI Strategist, and Forward Deployed Engineer, ending with comp range reveal: $250,000-$800,000 uncapped]
```
**Why it worked:** Transparent salary disclosure + ambitious hiring goals + specific role details

---

**#2: WhatsApp AI Groups Post (6,071 engagements, 450k impressions)**
```
"The best AI tools & tactics are stuck in private chats and buried Slack threads. So I'm spinning up a few WhatsApp groups for folks who are actively using AI in their day-to-day. First is an AI group for ceos/founders. Second is an AI group for engineers & engineering leaders. Third is an AI group for marketers & marketing leaders. No sales pitches. Just smart people sharing how they're using AI to move faster, do more, and stay ahead. If you want to join one of these groups, reply with 'ai' and I'll DM you an invite."
```
**Why it worked:** Community creation + simple CTA ("reply with 'ai'") + role-specific segmentation (4,000+ comments)

---

**#3: 12-Month Entrepreneurship Curriculum (4,723 engagements, 192k impressions)**
```
[Detailed quarterly curriculum with specific teachers per topic]
Q1: Foundation of Self (Keith Rabois, George Mack, Peter Thiel...)

Super exciting, right? Also incredibly stressful."
```
**Why it worked:** Vulnerable storytelling even in sponsored content + specific numbers + relatable struggle

---

**#5: Can't Hire Fast Enough (4,301 engagements)**
```
"I can't hire fast enough. Tenex is growing like a venture-backed startup, but is 100% bootstrapped. Our bet is simple...

1. AI is a wildly transformative technology.
2. Businesses need to go from AI-absent to AI-native.
3. Making that transition is challenging.
4. Software companies aren't incentivized to help with this. Traditional consultancies don't have the skills to help with it.
5. We fill the void."
```
**Why it worked:** Simple numbered thesis + market positioning + hiring CTA
