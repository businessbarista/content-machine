## How This File Works

This file accumulates writing lessons learned from your edits, feedback, and revision history. It is read alongside `style-guide.md` (for newsletter/social content) and the content type spec (for format-specific content like playbooks) during drafting.

- **If a lesson here conflicts with a style guide rule, the lesson takes priority** — it represents newer, specific learning.
- Lessons are added via `/content-machine --learn` or auto-prompted at the end of revision loops.
- Each lesson includes its source project, date, and confidence level.
- When this file reaches 30 lessons, you'll be prompted to review: graduate proven lessons into the style guides, archive stale ones, or merge similar ones.
