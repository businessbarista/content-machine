# Content Type: X Thread

## Overview

- **Command flag:** `--x-thread` (or selected during Step 4)
- **One-line description:** Punchy, hook-heavy X/Twitter thread
- **Typical length:** 10-15 tweets, 280 characters each
- **Platform:** X (Twitter)

## Pipeline

**Pipeline:** standard

## Format Specification

### Structure

- **Tweet 1 (The Hook):** Must stand completely alone and create curiosity. End with a signal that more is coming (e.g., `...` or `A thread 🧵`).
- **Tweets 2-N (The Body):** One idea per tweet. Each tweet should make sense if someone only reads that one. Build the argument progressively.
- **Final Tweet (The Close):** Takeaway + optional CTA (follow, repost, reply). Can callback to tweet 1.

### Voice & Tone Adaptation

Full casual voice from style-guide.md — this is the most casual format:

- Lowercase fine
- Abbreviations encouraged
- Sentence fragments encouraged
- No section dividers
- No blockquote formatting — use inline quotes with quotation marks
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences per visual block)
- Emojis sparingly and only if part of the author's natural voice

### Length & Constraints

- **Hard limit:** 280 characters per tweet
- **Thread length:** 10-15 tweets (sweet spot is 8-12)
- Each tweet must be self-contained enough to work as a standalone screenshot
- Thread must be scannable — someone skimming should get the core argument
- Number tweets for readability: `1/` or `1)` at the start

## Drafting Instructions

1. Read `style-guide.md` + `content-lessons.md`
2. Write tweet 1 first — spend the most time here. It determines whether anyone reads the rest.
3. Outline the thread as a list of one-line ideas before writing full tweets
4. Each tweet = one point. If a point needs two tweets, it's too complex — simplify or split
5. Include at least 2-3 tweets that are individually screenshot-worthy (a stat, a punchline, a framework)
6. The thread should feel like a conversation, not a lecture
7. Verify each tweet is under 280 characters

## Council Adaptations

Standard Writer's Council with one adjustment:
- **Shaan Puri's review gets extra weight** — virality and hook quality are disproportionately important for threads
- Each tweet should be evaluated for scroll-stop potential, not just the opening

## Revision Notes

- If the thread is too long (15+), the quality usually drops in the middle — cut the weakest 2-3 tweets
- Tweet 1 rewrites are always worth the time — test multiple hooks
