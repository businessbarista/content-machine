# Content Type: Long Post

## Overview

- **Command flag:** `--long-post` (or selected during Step 4)
- **One-line description:** Story-driven long-form post for newsletter, blog, or cross-posting
- **Typical length:** 1,000-2,500 words
- **Platform:** Newsletter, blog, or cross-posted to social

## Pipeline

**Pipeline:** standard

## Format Specification

### Structure

- **Hook** (1-3 sentences) — must pass the scroll-stop test. Create curiosity or tension.
- **Setup** — the situation, context, or framing that makes the reader care
- **Body** — the core argument or story. Can be:
  - Numbered key points (e.g., "7 things that hit me from this interview")
  - Story arc (setup → tension → resolution → lesson)
  - Argument building (thesis → evidence → implications → action)
- **Action items / "So what"** — what the reader should do with this information. Must be specific and novel.
- **Closing** — a memorable final line that sticks. Often a callback to the opening or a direct address to the reader.

### Voice & Tone Adaptation

Full application of style-guide.md. This is the most personal format — the author's authentic voice should come through strongest here.

- Preserve the author's actual words from the raw file wherever possible
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max for social platforms)
- Liberal use of line breaks for readability

### Length & Constraints

- 1,000-2,500 words depending on topic depth
- No hard character limit (adapt for platform during final formatting)
- For X: no section dividers (`---`), no blockquote formatting, shorter paragraphs
- For LinkedIn: 3,000 character limit, hook must work above the fold (~210 chars)
- For newsletter: more room for depth, can include section headers

## Drafting Instructions

1. Read `style-guide.md` + `content-lessons.md`
2. Pull stories, quotes, and data directly from the raw production file (Step 3)
3. Write the hook first — if the hook doesn't work, nothing else matters
4. Structure around the strongest insight or story from the interview
5. Match the author's voice exactly — their words, their rhythm, their punctuation
6. Action items must be novel and specific — if a consultant could have said it in 2023, it's not good enough
7. End with a line someone would text to a friend

## Council Adaptations

None. Use the standard Writer's Council.

## Revision Notes

- When the expert's quote is the strongest point in a section, end the section there — don't add editorial on top
- Cut editorial commentary in sections where the source material is doing all the work
- Keep the author's editorial for sections where they have a genuine, distinct POV to add
