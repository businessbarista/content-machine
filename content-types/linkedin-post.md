# Content Type: LinkedIn Post

## Overview

- **Command flag:** `--linkedin` (or selected during Step 4)
- **One-line description:** Professional-casual LinkedIn post with a pattern-interrupt hook
- **Typical length:** 200-700 words (3,000 character max)
- **Platform:** LinkedIn

## Pipeline

**Pipeline:** standard

## Format Specification

### Structure

- **Hook** (1-2 lines above the fold) — LinkedIn truncates at ~210 characters. The hook MUST create enough curiosity to click "see more."
- **Context/setup** (1-2 sentences after the fold)
- **Body** — choose one:
  - **Numbered list with bold headers** — scannable, high engagement
  - **Story arc** — setup → moment → lesson
  - **Contrarian take** — conventional wisdom → why it's wrong → the real answer
- **Takeaway or CTA** — what the reader should do, or a question that prompts comments
- **Optional:** "Reply with [word] if you want [thing]" engagement hook

### Voice & Tone Adaptation

Professional-casual — dial back the most casual elements of the author's social voice:

- Complete sentences more often (fewer fragments)
- Fewer abbreviations and slang
- Capitalize first words of sentences
- Still conversational — not corporate or formal
- Bold headers for list items
- Confident, not hedging

### Length & Constraints

- **Hard limit:** 3,000 characters
- **Sweet spot:** 1,500-2,500 characters
- Hook must work in ~210 characters (before the fold)
- Numbered lists with **bold headers** perform well
- Line breaks between every thought — dense paragraphs get skipped on LinkedIn
- No section dividers (`---`)
- No blockquote formatting — use inline quotes with quotation marks

## Drafting Instructions

1. Read `style-guide.md` + `content-lessons.md`
2. Start with the hook — write 3 options, pick the strongest
3. If adapting from a longer post: cut aggressively, keep the 3-5 strongest points
4. Every paragraph should justify its existence — if it doesn't add new information, cut it
5. Bold the key phrase in each section so skimmers get the argument
6. End with something that makes people want to comment or share
7. Count characters before finalizing — must be under 3,000

## Council Adaptations

None. Use the standard Writer's Council.

## Revision Notes

- Character count is non-negotiable — if over 3,000, cut rather than compress
- The hook is make-or-break on LinkedIn — if Shaan's review says it doesn't stop the scroll, fix the hook before anything else
